Create a web page using JavaScript to display concepts in draggable bubbles. The concepts are:

Aspect       | GPT Models                              | LLaMA Models
------------ | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------
Size         | GPT-3: 175 billion parameters           | Variable, designed to be competitive
             | GPT-4: Larger than GPT-3                |
Performance  | High performance in various NLP tasks   | Competitive with other large models
             | GPT-4 shows improvements over GPT-3     | Efficient and effective in language tasks
Cost         | High development and training costs     | High development and training costs
             | Subscription-based API pricing          | Potentially competitive pricing
             |                                         | Possible open access for research

Requirements:
1. Each concept should be in its own bubble.
2. Connect related bubbles with lines.
3. Use different colors for GPT (e.g., green) and LLaMA (e.g., blue) bubbles.
4. Make the bubbles draggable, and ensure connections dynamically update as bubbles are moved.
